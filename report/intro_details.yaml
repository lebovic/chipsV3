caption: 'The CHIPs pipeline is designed to perform robust quality control and reproducible processing of the chromatin profile sequencing data derived from ChIP-seq, DNase-seq, and ATAC-seq. CHIPs analysis is implemented across ten main procedures: Read alignment; Quality control; Sample contamination; Copy number variation calling; Peak calling; Fraction of reads in peaks (FRIP) score and PCR bottleneck coefficient (PBC); Annotation with the cis-regulatory element annotation system (CEAS), including intersection with union DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHS); Gene target prediction; Motif enrichment; Evolutionary conservation. The inputs to the pipeline are FASTQ/BAM format DNA sequence read files. The pipeline itself is encoded in the workflow language snakemake and executed in a conda environment using the cluster engine. The workflow is shown here. For any questions contact the developers at cidc-atac@ds.dfci.harvard.edu.'
