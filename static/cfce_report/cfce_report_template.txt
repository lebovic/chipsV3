Alignment Summary
=================
    The raw reads for each sample were mapped to the reference genome (genome) using alignment software (see config.yaml).

    The **mapped reads** represent the number of reads which successfully map to the genome, while the **uniquely mapped reads** represent the subset of **mapped reads** that map to only one location in the genome.

    In most cases, more than **XX% of the total reads** should be **uniquely mapped**.  Contamination, low quality sequencing data, or poor library construction are just some of the reasons that a sample's uniquely mapped reads might not reach this threshold.

PBC Summary
=================
    **PBC** is a common measure used for determining sample complexity (ref).  After alignment the samples are then normalized (by **downsampling**) to **4 million reads**.  ???The uniquely mapped reads of that downsample are then piled-up.???  **Nd** is defined as the number of **unique region locations**.  **N1** is defined as then number of **unique region locations with only one read**.  The **PBC** is then simply calculated as **N1/Nd**.

    Good ChIP-seq samples typically have a **PBC score >= 0.90** (ref).

Peak FoldChange
===============
    **Peaks** are called using the **MACS** (version shown in "Peaks Summary Table) peak calling software.  The total peaks called, the peaks with > 10 fold change (i.e. **confident peaks**), and the peaks with > 20 fold change (i.e. **highly confident peaks**) for each **run** are represented below.

Peak Summits Characterization Table 
===================================
    Run peaks are also run through conservation and motif analysis.  The table below summarizes the results of both analysis.

    The **conservation plots** of **transcription factor** (ChIP-seq) runs typically show a **high focal point around peak summits** (characterized as "needle points"), while **histone** runs typically show a **biomodal peaks** (i.e. "shoulders").  Deviations from these typical results usually indicates problems with the ChIP-seq run (e.g. sample contamination, alignment problems, etc.)

    For **motif analysis**, the top 5000 most significant peak summits (ranked by MACS pvalue score) are used.  Though several motifs typically arise for each sample, only the **top hit** is shown.

Sequence Summary Table
======================
    The Sequence Summary table is simply the textual representation of what was shown graphically in the "Alignment Summary" and "PBC Summary" plots.  The FastQC column represents the median read quality (phred) score for the sample.  Typically **a median quality score of > 20 is good**.

{samplesSummaryTable}

Peaks Summary Table 
===================
**(called with {macsVersion}, {fdr})**
    The Peaks Summary table not only shows the statisics represented in the "Peak FoldChange" plots, but also give other statistics such as the **FRiP score, number of DHS peaks, and peak characterization**.

    **FRiP (or FRaction of reads In Peaks)** score is calculated by first downsampling to 4 million reads, and aligning those reads to the genome.  MACS is then used to call peaks on the resulting alignment (4M downsampled peaks).  The FRiP is simply the fraction of th 4 million reads that fall within a peak-region.

    **DNAse hyper-sensitive (DHS)** sites have been shown to be very active regions of the genome (ref).  Using a list of known DHS regions (specific to each species), the DHS peaks represent the number of 4M downsampled peaks that intersect with DHS peaks.

    The fraction of peaks that fall in **promoter, exon, intron, and intergenic regions** are also shown.

Sample GC information and Contamination Panel
=============================================
**GC information**    
   The median value/percent of **GC content** in each sample is displayed in the table below.  The distribution of these values is also plotted with the 50% line mark shown (GC distribution).  Typically, for **human samples**, the modal value should be roughly around the **42% mark** (ref).
**Contamination panel**
    A sub-sample of 100,000 reads from the raw file is take and then aligned against each species defined in the contamination panel (see config.yaml).  The reported values for each species represents the **percent of 100,000 reads that map to that species' reference genome**.
